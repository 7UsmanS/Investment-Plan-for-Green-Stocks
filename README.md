# Investment-Plan-for-Green-Stocks

Investing in Green Stocks - Using Mean-Variance portfolio optimization model, which is a nonlinear optimization problem.

The project aims to solve a nonlinear optimization problem involving a given a set of assets and a budget. The goal is to select an optimal mix of allocation of stocks such that the expected income of the selected portfolio is equal to some predefined value and risk which is given by the covariance of the portfolio is minimum and the return on investment is maximized. This project further reports the efficient frontier which is the range of outcomes of profit achieved for all risk levels.
